# 🌟 **kQuest**

### *A mission to level up before turning 20.*

## 🔥 What is kQuest?

kQuest is my personal 6-month challenge where I’m grinding on three major pillars of life — **DSA, Money, and Physique**.
It’s my way of breaking the old version of me and building a stronger, smarter, and more disciplined version before I hit 20.

This journey is all about:

* Becoming consistent
* Learning deeply
* Building real projects
* Growing financially
* Staying healthy & aesthetic

## 💪 **The 3 Pillars of kQuest**

### ⚡ 1. DSA & JavaScript Mastery

I’m aiming to solve **2–3 DSA problems every day** and build a strong command on JavaScript + core logic.
**Goal:** Solve **500+ problems** and become interview-ready before the journey ends.

---

### 💰 2. Income Growth

I’ll be working on **freelance gigs, websites, and client work** to start earning consistently.
**Goal:** Make **₹3,00,000** through projects during this quest.

---

### 🏋️‍♂️ 3. Physique & Fitness

I want to build a clean aesthetic body through regular workouts.
**Goal:** Workout **5 days every week**, improve stamina, and build confidence.

---

## 🧠 Why am I doing this?

Because I’m tired of playing life on easy mode.
It’s time to:

* Become disciplined
* Push my limits
* Build habits that actually change my life
* Get serious about my career, mind, and body

Before I turn 20, I want to look back and say:

> “I created a version of myself that I’m proud of.”

## 📊 How I'll Track My Progress

Every day, I’ll publish a short update where I track:

* DSA problems solved
* Money earned
* Workout done or not
* Daily learnings
* Wins & struggles

Everything will stay transparent — from zero to glow-up. 🌱➡️🔥
